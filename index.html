              An accordian is a useful graphical element that can be used to
              save space on a webpage by hiding information until the user
              interacts with it. An accordian is typically used when you have a
              large amount of content that needs to be presented in a compact
              space, such as a frequently asked questions section or a product
              description page.

              The accordian is a graphical element comprising a vertically
              stacked list of items, such as labels or thumbnails. An accordian
              is similar in purpose to a tabbed interface, a list of items where
              exactly one item is expanded into a panel.

              What if the user clicks on a collapsed card while another card is
              open?

          <div class="accordian-content">
            <p>
              If the user clicks on a collapsed card while another card is open,
              the currently open card should be collapsed first before expanding
              the clicked card. This behavior can be achieved by checking if
              there is any active accordion item, and if there is, collapsing it
              before expanding the clicked accordion item.

              When choosing an icon to indicate expansion, consider using a plus
              sign (+) to convey the idea of opening or adding something, and a
              minus sign (-) to convey the opposite. These icons are commonly
              recognized by users and can quickly communicate the function of an
              interface element. Additionally, ensure the icon is easily
              distinguishable at small sizes and looks crisp on various screen
              resolutions. Consider the overall design of your interface and
              choose an icon that fits well with the other design elements.
              Finally, test the icon with users to ensure it is clear and
              understandable
